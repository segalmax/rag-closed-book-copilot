Homework: Building a Full RAG Application
Objective
Design and implement a complete Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) web application based on a topic that genuinely interests you. This assignment evaluates your ability to design a knowledge base, implement vector retrieval using FAISS, integrate an LLM, and deliver a working web interface.
1. Choose a Meaningful Topic
Select a subject that is personally meaningful or professionally relevant to you.
* Examples:
* A hobby (sports analytics, movies, fitness, etc.)
* A professional domain (cybersecurity, finance, cloud computing, etc.)
* Academic research area
* Technical documentation
* Historical events
* Company knowledge base simulation
The more you care about the topic, the better your application will be.
2. Build the Knowledge Base (Using FAISS)
Create a knowledge base containing real and relevant data.
* Requirements:
* Collect real data (articles, documents, PDFs, structured text, etc.)
* Clean and preprocess the data
* Split the data into meaningful chunks
* Generate embeddings
* Store embeddings in a FAISS vector database
* Ensure semantic retrieval is working properly
* Deliverables:
* Description of data source
* Explanation of chunking strategy
* Explanation of embedding model used
* FAISS indexing implementation
3. Implement the RAG Pipeline
Build a complete RAG pipeline including:
* User submits a question
* Relevant documents are retrieved from FAISS
* Retrieved context is injected into the prompt
* LLM generates a grounded response
Make sure:
* The LLM answers based only on retrieved context
* The system reduces hallucinations
* You handle edge cases (no relevant results, empty queries, etc.)
4. Develop a Web Application
Create a working web application for your RAG system.
* Requirements:
* Clean and intuitive UI/UX aligned with your topic
* User input field for questions
* Display of model response
* Display of retrieved documents (recommended)
* Loading indicators
* Basic error handling
5. Validation and Testing
You must validate that your system works correctly.
* Test and demonstrate:
* Accurate retrieval
* Context-based answering
* Behavior when irrelevant questions are asked
* Performance with multiple queries
* At least 5 example test questions with results
6. Submission Requirements
* Submit:
* Source code (clean and documented)
* Short architecture explanation
* Screenshots or short demo video
* Example queries and outputs
* Brief reflection (what worked well, what could be improved)
Evaluation Criteria
* Quality of knowledge base
* Correct FAISS implementation
* Proper RAG pipeline integration
* UI/UX design
* Code quality
* Validation and testing depth
* Creativity and originality
